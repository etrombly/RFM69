This is a port of the RFM69 library for arduino from https://github.com/LowPowerLab/RFM69 to python for raspberry pi.
Attach the RFM69 as follows:  
RFM pin - Pi pin  
3v3     - 17  
DIO0    - 18 (GPIO24)  
MOSI    - 19  
MISO    - 21  
CLK     - 23  (=SCK)
NSS     - 24  
Ground  - 25  

You can change the interrupt pin (GPIO24) in the class init.  

prerequisites: RPi.GPIO and spidev

if you are using newer firmware you'll need to get a newer spidev, the old one is no longer working:

git clone https://github.com/Gadgetoid/py-spidev

cd py-spidev

sudo make install
